#Remove all zero-sized ordinary files from the directory passed as a command line argument.  Use the 
#present working directory if no argument is specified.  
#Be sure to verify a given argument is a directory 
#that exists before proceeding.  Use of the find utility will not be an acceptable solution.  
#Create a directory and use the touch command to create zero-sized files for testing.
