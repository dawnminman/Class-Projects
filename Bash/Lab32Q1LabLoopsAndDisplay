#Write shell scripts to solve the following problems. 
#Save each script in its own file per the shell script submission requirements on the class website. 
#Refer to the files in /opt/pub/csc225/data/lab28 and commands in lab 28. 
#Your scripts must properly function when executed from any location on the filesystem. 
#Within your script, change to the above directory before performing the requested actions. 
#1. Create a script which will use a for loop to cycle 
#through all labs in the directory and display information on each file. 
#Your output should resemble the following sample for each file in the directory: 
#File name: csc225-lab10-browng.pdf 
#Username: browng 
#Lab Number: lab10 
#Submitted: 11/05/18 @ 21:44 
#Checksum: d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e
