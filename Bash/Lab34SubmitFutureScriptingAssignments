#Write shell scripts to solve the following problems. Save each script in its own file per the
#shell script submission requirements on the class website.
#1. Write a shell script you can use to submit future scripting lab assignments. Your
#script shall:
#a. Accept a lab number as a command line argument. If no command line
#argument is provided, display an appropriate error message and exit the
#script.
#b. Execute the script command, saving the output to ~/bin/labXX.out
#where XX is the lab number accepted as an argument. Executing the
#script command will launch a recording shell. Within this shell you can
#demonstrate execution of your lab assignments. Type exit to terminate
#the recording shell and resume execution of your shell script.
#c. Execute a command string similar to the following to gather your shell script
#assignments and the output of the script command and generate a PDF for
#submission:
#a2ps -A fill -C -E -g -o - ~/bin/csc225-labXX-q??.sh ~/bin/labxx.out
#| ps2pdf - /opt/pub/csc225/submit/csc225-labXX-username.pdf
#Variables should be used to provide the value of XX in the command string
#above.
#Be sure to also change username to your actual username.
#Note: the a2ps command line above is one long command string.
#Part of the shell script submission process requires demonstrating its use in a recording
#shell (step b above). If you try to use the script you are writing for this lab to
#demonstrate itself, you may enter an infinite recursive loop of recording shells. When it
#comes time to submit this lab, demonstrate a previously written script within the
#recording shell instead of this one as part of the lab submission process.

# Purpose:      Make a shell script to submit assignments
# Description:   first accept a lab number as an argument,if not, exit.
#               next, execute the script command for that lab number
#               finally, execute a command string to gather the script
#               assingments and output of script command that makes
#               a pdf to submit.
